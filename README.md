# Reinforce

Have you ever wanted to implement reinforcement learing algorithms in C++, but did not want to leave the trusted API
of Python equivalents?
No? Oh...

Well, `Reinforce` is a C++ implementation of the Gymnasium spaces anyway, designed to bridge the use of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in C++. Its aim is to port existing spaces, wherever meaningful, and related features
of [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), allowing developers to squeeze the
last drop of performance out of their juicy training routines.

## Features

- **Gym Spaces:** Reinforce provides C++ implementations of common Gymnasium spaces whenever meaningful. For a seamless
  transition from the Python-based standard set by Gym their API is replicated as much as possible.
  All spaces implemented so far provide the basic public API:
    - (batch) `sampling`
    - `contains` checks
    - `repr`
    - `equality` comparison

  As of now, the following spaces are available:
    - `Discrete`
    - `Box`
    - `Graph`
    - `MultiDiscrete`
    - `MultiBinary`
    - `OneOf`
    - `Text`
    - `Tuple`
    - `Sequence`

- **XTensor:** Reinforce uses [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor) as its tensor operations backbone akin to `NumPy` for `Gymnasium`. This allows for speedy computation of the data generated by the Gym spaces. The
  `xtensor` API (
  see [xtensor-docs](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) is designed to resemble the
  `NumPy` API as much as possible can be used to interact with samples of most of the spaces.
- **Environments:** Reinforce plans to offer a small selection of environments for training RL models.
  Currently, only a version of `gridworld` of arbitrary dimensions is included.
- **Python Bindings**: In the future, I hope to export Reinforce to Python. Given the heavy template reliance, this is still
  being evaluated for feasibility. If you have advice or wish to share the workload on this, feel free to open an issue
  or discussion item!

## Getting Started

This project relies on several dependencies to function correctly:

- **CMake**, a cross-platform open-source build system generator.

- **Conan**, a C/C++ package manager.

The specific dependencies for the code to function are listed in the `conandata.yml` file. Conan will handle the
installation of these.

To install cmake/conan, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
pip install conan
```

Please note that these commands are for Ubuntu. If you're using a different operating system, please adjust the commands
accordingly.

After installing Conan, you can install the project-specific dependencies by running:

```bash
conan install .
```

This command needs to be run in the project directory and will install all the necessary dependencies listed in
the `conandata.yml` file.
Alternatively, using the provided `configure.sh` and `build.sh` scripts will handle the conan installation and cmake
configuration automatically; by default, it will configure a build folder named `build` in the project root. To get
started with this, clone the repository and build it by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maichmueller/reinforce.git
cd reinforce
./configure.sh --output build
./build.sh build
```

After building the project, you can install it by running:

```bash
./install.sh build
```

As of now, the documentation is still a work in progress. However, the test files under `tests` showcase basic usage.
